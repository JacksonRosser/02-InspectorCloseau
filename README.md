# DGM2760
This is where project folders for DGM2760 will be deposited.
NOTE TO SELF: Must stage changes, commit changes, THEN PUSH changes in order for everything to reach this repository. I understand that GitHub will not track the ammount of commits I do every day on that green-square calender because I'm pushing code instead. Oh well, lots of trial and error but we figured it out :)
